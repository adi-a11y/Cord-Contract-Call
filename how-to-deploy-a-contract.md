# How to Deploy Your Own Smart Contract on CORD

## 1. Account Membership and Balance
Make sure that your account is a `networkMember`. If not, use the sudo account to nominate the account as a `networkMember`. The next step is to acquire funds if not already available.

## 2. Go to [ui.use.ink](https://ui.use.ink/)
If you are deploying on a local node, select "Local Node" from the dropdown menu on the top left. If you are deploying on a live/test network, you won't find the CORD network, but you can replace the network address manually in the browser.

## 3. Upload New Contract Code
Choose "Upload New Contract Code," select the account name, contract name, and then upload the `.contract` code.
